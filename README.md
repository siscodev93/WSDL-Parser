# WSDL-Parser
Quickly Parse WSDL files into one simple to use class.

Today I started working on posting data to a clients sophisticated C# SOAP API. I am unfamilar with how soap parses it's envelops so to learn, I started my own parser.  Unlike other parsers this one will create only one or very few class files, and will pre validate data before sending it.

This program does not require Composer or PHPPhar.
